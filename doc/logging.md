# VCML Logging
VCML uses a centralized logging system that allows its individual components
and models to report on everything that happens during the simulation. Log
messages are split into five categories, listed below in priority order:

* `vcml::LOG_ERROR`: highest priority, used for reporting on errors, e.g., when
an exception is caught.
* `vcml::LOG_WARNING`: used for reporting abnormal events, such as missing files
or erroneous configurations.
* `vcml::LOG_INFO`: used for generic info messages, e.g., for printing out the
simulation duration or bus memory maps at the beginning of the simulation.
* `vcml::LOG_DEBUG`: for printing debug messages
* `vcml::LOG_TRACE`: lowest priority, used for tracing transactions entering or
exiting buses or peripheral components.

Log message output adheres the following format:

`[<LEVEL> <TIME>] <SOURCE>: <MESSAGE>`

In this format, `<LEVEL>` refers to the log level and is shortened to its first
letter, i.e., `E`, `W`, `I`, `D` or `T`. After the log level, the current
SystemC time is printed with nanosecond resolution. One can optionally also
print out the current delta cycle after the time stamp by setting
`vcml::logger::print_delta_cycle = true`. The `<SOURCE>` of the log message is
automatically determined, depending on the log function you called (see below).
A full log message could therefore look like this:

`[D 1.000000200] system.uart0: component disabled`

This tells us that there was a debug message at *1s + 200ns*, informing us that
the component `system.uart0` has been disabled.

Log messages can be generated using the global top level logging functions from
the `vcml` namespace. These functions use the current SystemC process name as
the log message source. They use a `printf` style for string formatting:

```
namespace vcml {
    void log_error(const char* format, ...);
    void log_warn(const char* format, ...);
    void log_info(const char* format, ...);
    void log_debug(const char* format, ...);
}
```

Furthermore, the base class used for modeling hardware in VCML `vcml::component`
also provides logging functionality, that will add the name of the component
as the source of the log message:

```
namespace vcml {
    class component {
    public:
        // ...
        void log_error(const char* format, ...);
        void log_warn(const char* format, ...);
        void log_info(const char* format, ...);
        void log_debug(const char* format, ...);
        // ....
    };
}
```

----
## Logging Output
In order to actually see log messages, you need a logger that will receive the
messages and display them in some form. VCML currently provides three loggers:

* `vcml::log_term`: write the log message to `stderr` using color if available.
* `vcml::log_file`: write log messages to a file specified during construction.
* `vcml::log_stream`: sends the log messages to any `std::ostream` instance.

Each logger can furthermore also specify the log levels it is interested in.
This is done by calling the appropriate `set_level` methods as shown below:

```
vcml::log_file my_logger("log.txt");
my_logger.set_level(vcml::LOG_ERROR); // only receives error messages
my_logger.set_level(vcml::LOG_ERROR, vcml::LOG_INFO); // receives error, warning and info messages
```

Having multiple loggers for different purposes is possible and encouraged. You
could have for example a logger that exclusively receives messages from the
`vcml::LOG_DEBUG` level and writes them to a files. Then you could have a second
logger to print all other messages to console:

```
#include <vcml.h>

int sc_main(int argc, char** argv) {
    vcml::log_file debug("debug.txt");
    debug.set_level(vcml::LOG_DEBUG);

    vcml::log_term terminal;
    terminal.set_level(vcml::LOG_ERROR, vcml::LOG_INFO);

    ...
}
```

Log printing is customizable to a certain extent, by setting the following
static print control variables of `vcml::logger::print_xxx` before or during
simulation:

| Print control       | Description                                 | Default |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------|
| `print_time_stamp`  | Print the SystemC time of the log message   | `true`  |
| `print_delta_cycle` | Print the delta-cycle of the log message    | `false` |
| `print_sender`      | Print sending process or module             | `true`  |
| `print_source`      | Print the source location of the log call   | `false` |
| `print_backtrace`   | Print backtraces for logged reports         | `true`  |

It is also possible to create your own logger if you need to process VCML log
messages in a customizable way. To define a custom logger, derive from
`vcml::logger` and override `vcml::logger::write_log`:

```
class my_logger: public vcml::logger {
public:
    my_logger() ...
    virtual ~my_logger() ...
    virtual void log_line(const logmsg& msg);
};
```

When you are not using a custom `main` function, VCML will provide a default
one for you that accepts the following logging related program arguments:

* `-l <file>` or `--log <file`: creates a `vcml::log_file(<file>)`
* `-l` or `--log`: without an extra filename, creates a `vcml::log_term`
* `--log-debug`: elevates the log level of all loggers to `LOG_DEBUG`
* `--log-delta`: toggles `vcml::logger::print_delta_cycle`

----
## Exceptions
The logging system is typically also used for exception reporting. VCML
generally uses the class `vcml::report` for exceptions, so a basic approach to
exception handling would be:

```
int sc_main(int argc, char** argv) {
    vcml::log_term logger;
    try {
        // construct system
        sc_core::sc_start();
        return 0;
    } catch (vcml::report& r) {
        vcml::logger::log(r);
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    } catch (std::exception& e) {
        vcml::log_error(e.what());
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
}
```

This is also the default implementation used when not defining a custom `main`
function in your program.

*Note*: when you are using `vcml::logger::log(const vcml::report&)` to log an
exception, VCML will additionally print the call stack from when the exception
was thrown for debug purposes. This behaviour can be disabled by setting
`vcml::logger::print_backtrace = false`.

----
## Tracing
The logging subsystem also features basic TLM transaction tracing functionality.
To take advantage of it, you need to create a logger that accepts messages from
the `vcml::LOG_TRACE` log level. If you are not defining a custom `main`
function in your program, you can create a default trace file logger using
`--trace <filename>`, or a stderr logger using `--trace` (without a file).

You can also use `vcml::trace` and `vcml::trace_errors` to log transactions or
just transactions that have an error state set. This feature is generally used
with buses and peripheral components to report on incoming and outgoing
transactions. The transaction type must be `tlm::tlm_generic_payload`. The
transaction will be converted to string using the following format:

`<DIR> <OP> <ADDRESS> [<VALUE>] (<RESPONSE>)`

Here, `<DIR>` refers to the direction of the transaction. Outgoing requests are
denoted with a `>>`, incoming responses use `<<`. `<OP>` refers to the access
operation and can be `RD` (read) or `WR` (write). `<ADDRESS>` shows the
destination address in hex and `<VALUE>` contains the individual byte values of
the internal transaction buffer. `<RESPONSE>` holds the current state of the
transaction, see the TLM reference manual for details. Following is an example
of an actual TLM transaction trace:

* reading four bytes from address 0x100: `<< RD 0x0000100 [00 FF 00 FF] (TLM_OK_RESPONSE)`
* writing single byte to invalid address: `<< WR 0xFFFFFFFF [EE] (TLM_ADDRESS_ERROR_RESPONSE)`
